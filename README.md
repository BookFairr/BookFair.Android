## What is BookFair?

BookFair is an easy way for parents and students to buy and sell new and used textbooks with people in close proximity.
Bookfair’s algorithm will make it easy to find the items you want from the people you know by using friends, connections, age and location. Users will be able to chat privately and make online purchase.

This idea stemmed from the the frustration parents have each year when it comes on to their extensive booklist; and frustration we found having textbooks in great condition but lack of a way to easily sell them. BookFair bridges the gap between both 
parties and provides the platform to alleviate our age-long problem.
